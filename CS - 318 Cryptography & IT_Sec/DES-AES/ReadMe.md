  <li>lab3.java</li>

"AES.java" is delivered by lecturer Pardeep Kumar

Using the “AES.java” file as an example, I created a “DES.java” file that performs encryptionand decryption using DES.

"lab3.java " use the functionality provided by “AES.java” and "DES.java" to that encrypts and decrypts a message of my choosing using both a randomly generated key, and a key of my own choice.  Program print to the screen the original message, the encrypted version of the message using both keys and the decrypted version of the message using both keys.
