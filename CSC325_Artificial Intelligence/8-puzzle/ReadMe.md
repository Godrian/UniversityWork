## Task 1
Write a Python program to solve the 8-Puzzle.
<ul>
  <li>Randomly generate an 8-puzzle board that has a solution.</li>
  <li>Solve the puzzle. Run program multiple times and record the average processing time and the average number of moves.</li>
</ul>

## Task 2

Use a different algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle and compare the result with your solution from Task 1.  E.g., if <b>Greedy</b> search was used in Task 1, use <b>A*</b> in Task 2 or vice versa.
